- 👋 Hi, I’m @fakefloordiv
- 👀 I’m interested in network programming and compiler theory
- 🌱 Currently I'm maintaining own web-framework, sometimes switching to other pet-projects:)
- ⚡️ I value performant software and hate bloated towers of inefficient and stupid abstractions for the sake of imaginary "comfort" or "readability"
- 👤 Open for part-time job!
- 🗣 Speaking in English, German, Ukrainian and Russian
- 📱 You can reach me via [E-Mail](mailto://romanenko@pavlo.ooo) or Telegram
- 🐱‍👤 How deep is the rabbit hole?
